            <h2>Professional Lawn Care Services</h2>
            <p>Maintaining a healthy, vibrant lawn requires professional expertise and regular care. Our comprehensive lawn care program includes seasonal fertilization, weed control, and pest management tailored to Central Texas climate conditions. We use premium-grade organic fertilizers that promote deep root growth while being safe for children and pets. Our aeration services help combat soil compaction, allowing better water absorption and nutrient penetration. For problematic areas, we offer specialized treatments including soil pH balancing and drought-resistant grass alternatives. Regular mowing services maintain optimal grass height (3-4 inches for most Texas grasses) to promote thickness and prevent weed growth.</p>
